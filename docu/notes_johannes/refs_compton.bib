abstract = {In the framework of the refined resonating-group model (RRGM) observables of the photo- and electrodisintegration of 4He into p- and n-channels and those of the corresponding radiative-capture reactions in the giant-resonance energy region are calculated explicitly taking into account meson-exchange currents. The most recent experimental photo- and electrodisintegration cross sections as well as the radiative-capture analyzing powers are well described. Meson-exchange currents are found to make large contributions to the dominant E1 and the M1 transition. Large discrepancies to older calculations are explained.}

  abstract={The LIT method has allowed ab initio calculations of electroweak cross sections in light nuclear systems. This review presents a description of the method from both a general and a more technical point of view, as well as a summary of the results obtained by its application. The remarkable features of the LIT approach, which make it particularly efficient in dealing with a general reaction involving continuum states, are underlined. Emphasis is given on the results obtained for electroweak cross sections of few-nucleon systems. Their implications for the present understanding of microscopic nuclear dynamics are discussed.}

 abstract = {This book offers a concise introduction to the angular momentum, one of the most fundamental quantities in all of quantum mechanics. Beginning with the quantization of angular momentum, spin angular momentum, and the orbital angular momentum, the author goes on to discuss the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients for a two-component system. After developing the necessary mathematics, specifically spherical tensors and tensor operators, the author then investigates the 3-j, 6-j, and 9-jsymbols. Throughout, the author provides practical applications to atomic, molecular, and nuclear physics. These include partial-wave expansions, the emission and absorption of particles, the proton and electron quadrupole moment, matrix element calculation in practice, and the properties of the symmetrical top molecule.},

abstract = {A benchmark is set on the three-nucleon photodisintegration calculating the total cross section with modern realistic two- and three-nucleon forces using both the Faddeev equations and the Lorentz integral transform method. This test shows that the precision of three-body calculations involving continuum states is considerably higher than experimental uncertainties. Effects due to retardations, higher multipoles, meson exchange currents and Coulomb force are studied.}

abstract = {We calculate the electromagnetic properties of lithium and beryllium nuclei within a resonating group model using bare charges and g-factors. For 6Li we give results for reduced transition strengths and explain the tiny quadrupole moment. For 7Li and 7Be we compute electromagnetic moments and transitions between bound states. Furthermore we reproduce the existing data on the radiative captures 3He(α, γ)7Be and 3H(α, γ)7Li. In the 7Li case the calculations indicate an increase of the astrophysical S- factor for decreasing energy which might have astrophysical consequences. We show that closed channels do not influence results on the astrophysical S-factor at low energy. Finally we demonstrate that the polarisability of 7Li originates from the virtual break-up at low energies. In this case, the 6Li + n channels contribute appreciably.}
